Local full install (in a subdirectory on their domain)
last 30-50 entries initially visible on Voucher Entry page (use DataTables in Flatty)
all entries added today are selected by default, others are unchecked
as entries are added, they are added to the top of the DataTable (sorted newest at the top / or voucher id descending)
will need a way to edit them - so I think the Voucher ID in the table should be clickable - which will put that voucher info into the form
About would just contain some text that is controlled in the code - including version number
Settings page just saves the defaults 
There is one more field  - the "mystery field" is always set to "3700" - no one knows what this is for - it should be in the "defaults / settings" and on the output.
a simple htaccess / apache verification for folder access instead of building an authorization system - at least at first for this one client.
